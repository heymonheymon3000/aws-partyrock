# Restaurant Recommender

## 🌟 Overview

In this project, I used PartyRock to develop a 'Restaurant Recommender' to assist users in finding a restaurant based on the user’s input, location, preferred cuisine and mealtime. PartyRock is a new platform offered by AWS designed to simplify app development through the use of generative AI.

## 🛠️ Learnings and Challenges

At the moment partyrock is limitied in what it can do and it is constantly being refined. In the beginning I did not understand the workflow but after viewing a tutorial for 30 minutes I was up and running no time.
